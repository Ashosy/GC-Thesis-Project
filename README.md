# Plastic Waste Recycling on the Household level using Machine Learning

## Abstract:

One of the major problems facing the environment today is plastic waste. Urban plastic usage thereby disposal is continually increasing with no signs of regulation. This results in severe environmental ramifications which might be difficult to mitigate if left unattended. Several international efforts have already been exerted towards a more sustainable and regulated plastic usage and disposal mechanisms, however these efforts have mainly been on a large-scale level.  We believe that tackling the problem at its roots would likely lead to a longer term solution.

Recycled plastic can be used for a variety of purposes including clothing, packaging, home furnishings etc.  However, different types of plastic serve different purposes thus it becomes crucial to process hence dispose plastics separately. Arising from the information we've gathered concerning plastic usage and recycling methods, we propose a user-friendly application that can identify different types of plastic which the user can segregate into separate disposal units for later recycling. The user can also track their plastic usage over a specified amount of time to create mindfulness and motivation towards using alternatives to plastic. An accessible and easy-to-use platform coupled with efficient plastic identification system is, in our opinion, what we need to create awareness and widely share environmental responsibilities while actively regulating the communities' plastic usage.
